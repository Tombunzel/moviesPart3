Welcome to my movies database CLI

This program:
  handles a database of movies,
  fetches information from the web,
  allows the user to make changes to the data
  allows the user to fetch certain information from the data (like a random movie)
  generates a website for a neat preview of the movies in storage, including the movie's poster and country of production

Use the terminal to run the script: python3 main.py <file_name>, and follow the options on the screen:

The data files created will be saved in the directory '/data'.
Each file will store the data separately from the other files, allowing different "users" to store their movies in a separate database.

The generated website will be saved to the _static folder under the file name "index.html". Currently, no server is available and the file must be opened locally.
