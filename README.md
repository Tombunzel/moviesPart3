Welcome to my Movies database CLI

This program:
  handles a database of movies,
  fetches information from the web,
  allows the user to make changes to the data
  allows the user to fetch certain information from the data (like a random movie)
  generates a website for a neat preview of the movies in storage, including the movie's poster and country of production
